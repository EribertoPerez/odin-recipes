So with this project we are trying to learn about html. 
The project is to build a basic recipe website. The website
will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Some of the things we want to accomplish are, making lists, 
images, links, etc. We also want it to be organized and concise
I will come back here and update after I am done. Thank You.

It is starting to look pretty good yo.
Just added the second recipe to the index file.

Now working on the third recipe. Pad Kra Pao Gai Kai Dao!.

Finished all three recipes for the project.
