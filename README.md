So with this project we are trying to learn about html. 
The project is to build a basic recipe website. The website
will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
Some of the things we want to accomplish are, making lists, 
images, links, etc. We also want it to be organized and concise
I will come back here and update after I am done. Thank You.
