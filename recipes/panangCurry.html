    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Phanaeng (Thai: พะแนง, pronounced [pʰā.nɛ̄ːŋ]), also spelled phanang, panang, and other variants) is a type of red Thai curry that is thick, salty and sweet, with a zesty makrut lime flavour.[1] The earliest known mention of phanaeng appears in Mom Somchin Rachanupraphan's book Tamra Kap Khao (ตำรากับข้าว), published in 1890.[2]

        A popular phanaeng curry dish is pork phanaeng.[citation needed] In Thailand, this curry is usually eaten with rice.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 Tbsp panang curry paste, store bought or homemade</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>8 oz (230g) thinly sliced pork tenderloin or another protein of your choice</li>
        <li>3 kaffir lime leaves, torn into chunks</li>
        <li>2 kaffir lime leaves, very thinly sliced for garnish</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp coconut milk for garnish</li>
        <li>Spur chilies or other types of mild red chilies, sliced into rounds for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the curry paste in some vegetable oil until aromatic, 2-3 minutes, and deglaze with ¼ cup of the coconut milk. Note: Traditionally, we sauté the curry paste in rendered coconut oil. See more information about this method in Green Curry videos.</li>
        <li>Add the 3 torn kaffir lime leaves and let the mixture cook, stirring constantly, until the coconut milk dries up again.</li>
        <li>Once the coconut milk has dried up, add pork to the pan and toss to coat thoroughly in the curry paste.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ½ cup of coconut milk, fish sauce, sugar, and cook until the pork is done.</li>
        <li>When the pork is done, remove from heat immediately.</li>
        <li>To serve: pour the curry on to a deep plate or a shallow bowl, spoon the 2 Tbsp of coconut milk over the top for garnish if desired. Top with thinly sliced kaffir lime leaves and spur chili slices. Serve with hot jasmine rice!</li>
